jfindent is a shell script calling jfindent.jar
findent (in a separate package) indents Fortran sources

jfindent requires Java version >= 1.6

Installing with recompiling:

   This is accomplished using the familiar commands: 
      ./configure 
      make clean
      make 
      make install 
   Use
      ./configure --help
   for details.

Installing using pre-build files:

   The tarball contains the folders 'bin' and 'share'

   bin/jfindent                    : a script to call jfindent.jar
   share/jfindent/lib/jfindent.jar : the findent jar file
   share/man/man1/jfindent.1       : the jfindent man page

   You can copy these files to your favorite locations.
   TAKE CARE to adapt the script jfindent to contain the
   proper location of jfindent.jar.

   There exists an issue concerning garbled text when scrolling horizontally
   with java programs in Ubuntu, maybe also in other environments.
   I found this reference: 
     https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openjdk-6/+bug/1032936
   The solution proposed is:
     export _JAVA_OPTIONS='-Dsun.java2d.xrender=true'
   which works fine for me on Ubuntu 14.04. 
   A better solution, that works for me on more systems:
      export _JAVA_OPTIONS='Dsun.java2d.opengl=true'
