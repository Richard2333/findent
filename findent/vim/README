To enable findent for vim, place
  findent.vim in ~/.vim/plugin/
  fortran.vim in ~/.vim/after/indent/

In .vimrc you can specify:

  let use_findent = 1   " use findent (default)
  let use_findent = 0   " do not use findent

  let findent = "location-of-findent" " default: 'findent'

  let use_findent_indentexpr = 1  " use findent for indentexpr
  let use_findent_indentexpr = 0  " do not use findent for indentexpr
                                  " see :help indentexpr

  let findent_flags = "<flags>"   " specify flags for findent, e.g.:
     let findent_flags = "-i4"    
     default is "-i".&shiftwidth

In findent.vim, the following mappings are defined
  (asuming your LocalLeader = \):

   \w  toggle: to determine the indent of the line being edited:
       use whole buffer (status line: wb)
       or use the last usable line
   \f  set/change flags for findent
   \c  comment current line
   \=  indent whole buffer

 Furthermore, command '==' is redefined, such that is does what
 one would expect.

In findent.vim the statusline is redefined. It shows the fortran format
(free or fixed) and wb (see \w above)

In fortran.vim the format (free or fixed) of the edited file is
determined from the extension:

  fixed: .f   .for .fpp .ftn .fortran .f77 
  free:  .f90 .f95 .f03 .f08

  If another extension is used (and filetype is fortran, of course),
  the format is deducted by findent: if in the first 4000 lines
  a proof is found for free format, the format is assumed to be
  free, else the format is assumed to be fixed.
