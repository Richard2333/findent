findent-2.5.0:
	findent.cpp:
	   - lines starting originally with '!' are not indented

          a statement label

findent-1.6.1:
   findent.l: 
      get rid of flex message: "warning, dangerous trailing context"
                by slight redefinition of statement-label

         treating them as comment lines.
	 Special treatment with -ofree: debug line as:
	    'd        print *,"debug",i'

      recognize 'abstract type' and 'abstract interface'

findent-1.5.7
   findent.l:
      recognize strings in 'rest' state
      more precise definition of function
      recognize 'endprogram'
      do not confuse 'do (i) =' witha do statement
   findent.y:
      fixed form: put an ' ' as possible separator between label and code


findent-1.5.6
   Makefile:
      added support for cross compiling to windows:
         make clean
	 make MINGW=1
      creates a windows 32 bit findent.exe

      ticket 1: 
         more precise recognition of function statement

findent-1.5.5
   findent.y:
      added support for conditional preprocessor statements. Example:
      #ifdef USEMPI
      subroutine mysub(a,b)
      real a,b
      #else
      subroutine mysub(a)
      real a
      #endif
      end subroutine mysub

      indents correctly now.

findent-1.5.4
   findent.y: 
      recognize ' x = 3 & ! comment' as a line needing a continuation
      preprocessor statements are handled on ad-hoc basis
   findent.l:
      preprocessor statements are not recognized any more

findent-1.5.3
   findent.y:
      add fixed-to-free: add check if this is a preprocessor line
      fixed-to-free: fixed fortran can have a trailing comment,
         starting with !, and have a continuation line.
         This is fixed.
      fixed-to-free: fixed bad handling of otherwise empty continuation lines
   findent.l: 
      better recognition of fixed and free
      recognize 'integer(kind=8) function func1(a,b)' as a function
