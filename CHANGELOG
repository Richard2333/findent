findent-1.6.5:
   Makefile:
      removed -g flag
      created 'zip' and 'tar' targets
   findent.y:
      added code and help text for the -L flag
   wfindent:
      added -L flag
   README:
      replaced NOTE 1, it covers now tab input.
   Added scripts 'makezip' and 'maketar'
   Added README.1st

findent-1.6.4:
   findent.y:
      determine if input comes from terminal, warn user
      and accept a single dot ('.') as end-of file
      Extended usage() with examples

findent-1.6.3:
   findent.l, findent.y, findent.h:
      implement refactor routines
   findent.y:
      bug fixes for fixed form continuation lines
         
findent-1.6.2:
      regcognise tabbed source: 
          <tab>[1-9] 
          is recognised as a continuation line
      fixed bug when tab follows label: ltab2sp now takes in acccount 
          a statement label

findent-1.6.1:
   findent.l: 
      get rid of flex message: "warning, dangerous trailing context"
                by slight redefinition of statement-label
              simplified else, elseif, elsewhere recognition
   findent.y: 
      recognize debug lines in fixed format ('d' or 'D' in colimn 1),
         treating them as comment lines.
	 Special treatment with -ofree: debug line as:
	    'd        print *,"debug",i'
	 will be output after conversion to free format as:
	    '!d        print *,"debug",i'

findent-1.6.0:
   Makefile:
      slight change in rule to make .o from .cpp
   wfindent:
      added
   findent.l:
      fixed recognition of elseif by better definition of {nc}
   README:
      describe wfindent
   INSTALL:
      install wfindent

findent-1.5.9:
   findent.l:
      recognize 'label :' ('label:' was already recognized)
      recognize false type as in 'typecode = 10'
      better discrimination between fixed and free
   findent.y:
      recognize '123 enddo', do not double-de-indent

findent-1.5.8:
   findent.y:
      fill indent-stack from 0 to start_indent with the default indent
   findent.l: 
      support for construct name in 'do' 'if' 'select' 'block' 
      recognize some forms of false end
      recognize 'abstract type' and 'abstract interface'

findent-1.5.7
   findent.l:
      recognize strings in 'rest' state
      more precise definition of function
      recognize 'endprogram'
      do not confuse 'do (i) =' witha do statement
   findent.y:
      fixed form: put an ' ' as possible separator between label and code


findent-1.5.6
   Makefile:
      added support for cross compiling to windows:
         make clean
	 make MINGW=1
      creates a windows 32 bit findent.exe
   findent.l:
      ticket 1: 
         more precise recognition of function statement

findent-1.5.5
   findent.y:
      added support for conditional preprocessor statements. Example:
      #ifdef USEMPI
      subroutine mysub(a,b)
      real a,b
      #else
      subroutine mysub(a)
      real a
      #endif
      end subroutine mysub

      indents correctly now.

findent-1.5.4
   findent.y: 
      recognize ' x = 3 & ! comment' as a line needing a continuation
      preprocessor statements are handled on ad-hoc basis
   findent.l:
      preprocessor statements are not recognized any more

findent-1.5.3
   findent.y:
      add fixed-to-free: add check if this is a preprocessor line
      fixed-to-free: fixed fortran can have a trailing comment,
         starting with !, and have a continuation line.
         This is fixed.
      fixed-to-free: fixed bad handling of otherwise empty continuation lines
   findent.l: 
      better recognition of fixed and free
      recognize 'integer(kind=8) function func1(a,b)' as a function
              Thanks to Dusan Jovic
      removed 'select' from definition of explicitly not-handled keywords


findent-1.5.2
   findent.l:
      let lexer recognise 'type, public :: mytype' Thanks to Dusan Jovic
findent-1.5.1
   findent.l:
      added some patterns to distinguish between fixed and fixed format
   findent.y:
      fix for files that do not end with \n
      fix for correct indenting continuation line while converting 
findent-1.5
   README:
      add recipe to use equalprg in vim
   findent.y:
      add ';' in to rules to quiet bison-2.5
      fix placement of preprocessor lines if they are in a 
         continuation suite
      enlarge number of lines to be considered when determining
         fixed or free from 10 to 1000
   findent.l:
      fix definition of {neol}

findent-1.4
   findent.y:
      make sure that string(n,' ') is always called with n >= 0
findent-1.3
   version.h:
      set version to 1.3
   findent.h:
      add definition for lexer_set()
   findent.l:
      add lexer_set()
      in lexer_init(): change lexer_push() to lexer_set()
   findent.y:
      replace lexer_pop()...lexer_push() sequences by lexer_set()
   minor code cleaning.
   Makefile: 
     'test' dependent of 'all'
     'clean' also cleans test directory
   test/progfixed_dos.f:
      add -ifixed in first line
   test/progfree_dos.f:
      add -ifree in first line
